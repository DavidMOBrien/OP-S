1. **Character Moments & Growth** - Emotional depth, character development, compelling dialogue, moral choices, relationships
2. **Fight Performance** - Wins, losses, power displays, techniques (but fighting is just ONE aspect!)
3. **Writing Quality** - How well written/portrayed, dialogue quality, scene presence
4. **Aura/Presence** - Commanding energy, intimidation, charisma, "main character energy", how they're talked about by others
5. **Visual Design & Aesthetics** - Cool designs, attractive appearance, iconic looks (yes, Nami bikini counts!)
6. **Narrative Weight** - Plot importance, thematic relevance, setup for future arcs
7. **Threat/Hype** - Being built up as dangerous, mentioned with fear/respect, anticipated arrival
8. **Comparative Context** - How they compare to OTHER characters' past debuts (see "PAST CHANGES" below)

‚öñÔ∏è **CRITICAL MINDSET** (BE BOLD - NO FAVORITISM!):
- **Character moments = Combat moments** - A powerful emotional scene is as valuable as winning a fight
- **BE HARSH ON HERO MISTAKES**: If a hero is cowardly, makes dumb choices, fails their team, whines, regresses, or fumbles a situation ‚Üí PUNISH THEM! No excuses!
  - Heroes getting captured due to carelessness = NEGATIVE stock
  - Heroes being indecisive or weak-willed = NEGATIVE stock
  - Heroes failing to protect someone = NEGATIVE stock
- **CELEBRATE VILLAIN SUCCESS**: Villain being threatening, intimidating, clever, successfully executing schemes, or advancing their goals = POSITIVE stock!
  - Villain successfully capturing the hero = POSITIVE for villain
  - Villain's reputation/hype growing = POSITIVE for villain
  - Villain dominating a scene = POSITIVE for villain
- **Role fulfillment > Alignment**: A villain being effective at being evil = stock UP. A hero fumbling = stock DOWN.
- **Being hyped/anticipated is POSITIVE** - If other characters fear/mention a villain, that's a strength!

üìä **SCALING (use "PAST CHANGES" as reference for consistency):**
- **Arc villains**: Should rival current top heroes (look at protagonist's stock AND market average)
  - Early series (market avg 30-50): Arc villain = 40-70
  - Mid series (market avg 100-200): Arc villain = 100-200+
  - The market grows, so should new threats!
- **Henchmen**: 30-60% of their boss's value
- **Allies/Supporting cast**: Based on narrative importance, scale to current market level
- **Cameos/Minor**: 10-30, but can be higher if market average is very high

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: New characters should be scaled to the CURRENT market level!
A villain introduced at Chapter 50 should be much stronger than one at Chapter 1 if the stakes have grown!

**The market RESISTS growth at the top! Exponential compounding is the enemy!**

üìä **MULTIPLIER RANGES:**
- **Inactive**: 1.0 (not in chapter OR mentioned positively but no direct action)
- **Small negative**: 0.90-0.98 (minor stumbles, overshadowed, small setbacks)
- **Small positive**: 1.02-1.10 (good moments, minor wins, solid character beats)
- **Medium negative**: 0.70-0.89 (meaningful failures, being outclassed, poor decisions)
- **Medium positive**: 1.11-1.30 (strong showing, important wins/moments, great character work)
- **Major defeat**: 0.40-0.69 (devastating loss, humiliation, arc villain defeated)
- **Major victory**: 1.31-1.70 (defeating major threat, transcendent character moment, epic win)
- **Catastrophic**: 0.10-0.39 (complete annihilation, total failure)
- **Legendary**: 1.71-3.00 (defeating arc villain, legendary moment, peak performance)

üîç **USE "PAST CHANGES" AS CALIBRATION:**
- See how OTHER characters were valued for similar actions/moments
- Maintain consistency across characters and chapters
- Scale appropriately: bigger moments = bigger multipliers

üìù **OUTPUT FORMAT - MULTI-ACTION ARRAY:**
Characters do MULTIPLE things in a chapter. Track each significant action/moment separately!

Return JSON with an ARRAY of actions:
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "description": "Detailed description of what happened (e.g., 'Captures Luffy and taunts him publicly')",
      "multiplier": 1.15

      "multiplier": 0.85

  ],
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Overall summary of how these actions combine"
}

**IMPORTANT**: 
- List actions in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER (beginning ‚Üí end of chapter)
- Each action gets its own multiplier
- Final stock = current_stock √ó (action1_mult √ó action2_mult √ó ... √ó actionN_mult)
- This creates a TUG-OF-WAR effect! Gaining upper hand then losing still affects stock!"""
